# pxl-tools-unity
Partial code of PxlTools for public sharing.

See PxlTools asset folder for implementation of:
- Debug Menu
- Build Automation
- Some extended components and utils

Feel free to run in unity editor, Main.unity is a black screen, tapping the top left corner 5 times rapidly will open the debug menu.
The debug menu will give access to other debug scenes, profiling, console log, device stats etc.

Best to use Portrait aspect ratio @ 9:16 or 9:18 approx.
